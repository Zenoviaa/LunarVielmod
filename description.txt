PLEASE PLAY MASTERMODE or EXPERTMODE FOR THIS MOD!
Also maybe try medium worlds if world gen is crashing!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Lunar Veil is an expansive mod for the world of Aimacra. As a crossover from a personal game Diari, 
Sirestias has sought to expand her skills in the world of terraria and she wants to eliminate all false gods and goddesses on the planet.

The ones that pose a threat to existence on the planet of terraria would be gods who own singularities. They cause inreversible damage and often corrupts the worlds and the minds within them.
People go out to worship these gods and protect them, and nobody dare stand up to the ones who rule their domains.

What new evils have befallen this world? Who knows :P
But your job is to eliminate all of them 

This is a content/quality of life mod which includes:
- Many new enemies and npcs
- 150+ New interesting weapons
- New systems for weapons and gameplay including Harvesting Spots, Weapon Powders, igniters, brooches and more!
- A Gambling feature for post bosses
- 2 New main town NPC
- Many Shop NPC's around the world!
- 50+ Accessories that will indefinetly help you with battles
- Many fleshed out biomes and structures around the world to keep you searching and exploring
- Castles, Dungeons and a very open and treasure filled world that makes it feel like a metroidvania!
- 5 main new bosses and some new side bosses all over the world of Prehardmode!
- Many main armors to flesh out prehardmode's lack of class armors
- A fully immersive soundtrack from both developers (Go check out my Diari Soundtrack, please lol)
