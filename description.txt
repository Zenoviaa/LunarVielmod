The Stella Mod is an expansive mod for the world of Aimacra and Stella! As a crossover from a personal game Diari, Stella has sought to expand her skills in the world of terraria!
When Sirestias, you and her crew teleported into the world of terraria you all kind of cracked the sky and the influence on world is quite dramatic..

Civilizations grew, spread and even found ways to make use of this difference in the world, they call what falls from this crack "gild," and people have figured out ways to manipulate and even 
grow more powerful with it..

What new evils have befallen this world? Who knows :P

This is a content/quality of life mod which includes:
- 1 Polished boss 
- A couple new enemies and npcs
- 30+ New interesting weapons
- New systems for weapons and GP including Harvesting, Weapon Powders and igniters
- A Gambling feature for post bosses
- 1 New main town NPC
- 5+ Accessories that will indefinetly help you with battles
- A fully fleshed out biome named the Morrow with great exploration (Pre-hardmode)
- 2 main armors to flesh out prehardmode's lack of class armors
- A fully immersive soundtrack (Go check Diari Soundtrack)
- Pretty much made by one gal named Zenovia :P

Keep in mind this is an early version of the mod!
(WARNING: THIS MOD ENCOURAGES YOU TO PLAY LIKE A GLASS CANNON + WORK ON EVASION)
