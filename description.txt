The Rosemary Mod is an expansive mod for the world of Aimacra. Rosemary and Sirestias! As a crossover from a personal game Diari, 
Rosemary has sought to expand her skills in the world of terraria as Sirestias has a reason to be here.

When Sirestias, you and her crew teleported into the world of terraria you all kind of cracked the sky and the influence on world is quite dramatic..
Civilizations grew, spread and even found ways to make use of this difference in the world, they call what falls from this crack "gild," and people have figured out ways to manipulate and even 
grow more powerful with it..
You are on the hunt for powerful beings as they pose a threat to you and your crew. They have become monarchs, and their plans are quite troublesome to Sirestias, it's your job to understand the world and 
exterminate the higher beings at all costs. 

What new evils have befallen this world? Who knows :P
