/*

- Deer with a singularity for a head, in its spawn animation at first it looks like a normal deer before the head explodes and parts start orbiting it, ooo I know exactly how to code this

- The legs and everything are rigged, we’ll use forward kinematics to animate the boss, so we’ll have to make a run animation and idle animation

- Opens the fight with several exploding blood magic projectiles that loosely track the player

- Winds up a charge and then runs directly at the player really fast, and explodes into bloody bits before merging itself back together elsewhere

- Runs up into the sky and rains down acidic blood

- Walks slowly around the player as bloody boils explode from its body and then home back towards you

- Cracks form in its body and it violently erupts into multiple bloody geysers

- Winds up a charge and then keeps running at you while swerving around and trying to juke you out
 
- In phase 2 every attack gets more deadlier, triggers at under 50% health
