		PLEASE PLAY MASTERMODE or EXPERTMODE FOR THIS MOD!
			MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBLE!!!
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			The Lunar Veil is an expansive mod for the world of Aimacra. As a crossover from a personal game Diari,
			Sirestias has sought to expand her skills in the world of terraria and she wants to eliminate all false gods and goddesses on the planet.

			The ones that pose a threat to existence on the planet of terraria would be gods who own singularities. They cause inreversible damage and often corrupts the worlds and the minds within them.
			People go out to worship these gods and protect them, and nobody dare stand up to the ones who rule their domains.

			What new evils have befallen this world? Who knows :P
			But your job is to eliminate all of them

			This is a content/quality of life mod which includes:
			- Many new enemies and npcs
			- 200+ New interesting weapons
			- New systems for weapons and gameplay including Harvesting Spots, Weapon Powders, igniters, brooches and more!
			- A Gambling feature for post bosses
			- 4 New main town NPC
			- Many Shop NPC's around the world!
			- 50+ Accessories that will indefinetly help you with battles
			- Many fleshed out biomes and structures around the world to keep you searching and exploring
			- Castles, Dungeons and a very open and treasure filled world that makes it feel like a metroidvania!
			- Many new bosses around both prehardmode and hardmode now!
			- Many main armors to flesh out prehardmode's lack of class armors
			- A fully immersive soundtrack from both me and Azza (Go check out my Diari Soundtrack, please lol)
			- Pretty much made by three people, Me, Azzalea and Scolon!
			- Over 600 new items!
			- Many new quality of life addons to make the terraria experience better :)

			Keep in mind this is mainly prehardmode content so far!
			(WARNING: THIS MOD ENCOURAGES YOU TO WORK ON EVASION)
			There is plenty of hardmode content as of the Stars and Bloom update!

		---------------------------------------

		This higher being is of the Iyx family. Related to Verlia and Vixyl they hold a high amount of skill and passion for the things they love.
		They are to be believed to be seperated at birth from Rosemary of Ekrose from their other sister. 

		This specimen bears heavy grudges and will attempt to do anything to reconcile. 
		She had her village (Govheil Castle) taken away from her as the acidic corruption took her people, her ginzte army and her friends.
		After Fenix took and trapped her sister this beig took a journey to go seek power from Lumi Veil, another benounced god to save her.
		I believe she may have taken a weak singularity and bounded it to Daedus for protection meaning she is most likely the strongest being over
		Fenix without using a singularity's power. 

		She currently is gone but the people who escaped the acid from taking over ended up going to the fable, they pay their respects to her here.
		We can only assume she has been training to save her sister for the past 30 years...

		---------------------------------------

		This higher being is of the Veil family and is one of the two sisters of Lumi Veil.
		She also is related to Dreadmire, formally known as Cozmire and has a singularity that guards her soul.

		This specimen has a strong resemblence to the stars and was heavily connected to Cozmire throughout her life.
		Through family complications this higher being sought power to gain connection to her other sisters. She sought
		out more power through a singularity with Lumi and ended up becoming powerful but to no avail of having more of a 
		bond. A being of care and overthinking. She may prove to be a challenge due to her soul being binded but she is lost,
		so take advantage of that. She also took part in sealing Sigfried so her and Zui have a small connection.

		Currently they are residing in the stars watching from above, sleeping and casting Aurorean starfalls with their dreams.
		They await for their sister's rebound.

		Belonging to the Sepsis family, being the old lord of the Illuria and the Lunar tree, of all things silver.

		Sigfried seemed to have no relative connection but was a masterclass thief who bit off more than they could chew.
		He has a brother who now holds the throne in Illuria. Once a vigilante who sought peace turned insane by taking in the power
		of a high singularity, Pulsar Fragment. 40 or 50 so years ago Sigfried stole a singularity from Lumi Veil and merged it with his body.
		Unknowingly doing this caused him to loose control of his body and destroying the world as we know it. Killing of Fenix's parents, which
		would allow her to rise to the throne of her own Capital and becoming crazy herself. He was exiled after the destruction and was trapped
		within a Pulsing Key which is hidden away deep underground, Zui being the one to stop him.

		To bring out Lumi we may need to reawaken him.

		---------------------------------------

		This higher being is of the Veil family and is one of the two sisters of Lumi Veil.
		Using all of her power for evil and demonic purposes and causing her family disfunction this being is very interesting.

		Cozmire was one out of the two sisters that were given life by Lumi Veil. Cozmire was granted the power of the cosmos, 
		hence her name. She left the skies to use her powers for alternative purposes and damaged their family relations, making 
		Azurerin feel incomplete. Lumi sent dreadmire a singularity to let her know that she was still cared for in the family
		yet she gave it away to fenix for more power. This trade corrupted her soul and Fenix ended up using the singularity
		for some heinous deeds it seems although she never put it in her soul. Cozmire was weakened by this and is now
		awakened by a cyst during the most evil times of the year, a blood moon. We should take advantage of her weak form.

		Now know as Dreadmire, people look up to her for evil purposes and to bring the rein of the red cosmos to the people.
		Would take her out because of this.

		---------------------------------------

		This higher being is of the Veil family. Related to Azurerin and Cozmire as they ascend all those that come before them. 
		They are to be believed to be the strongest on this planet. Aside from me :p 

		This specimen is lively but patient, being a creator of the sorts and caring for her family.
		She gifted her two sisters both life and singularities to prove that she cares for both of them. Being a collector of singularities
		has it's issues as we can see though.

		Azurerin took up the stars and obtained the Supernova fragment while Cozmire had the power of the cosmos having the Singularity fragment.
		Although she is gifted and powerful, we all know that these singularities are the reason that the world is crumbling with evil
		power and fantasies that cost the lives of many. Hence so we shall bring her off her throne and slay her.

		She currently is above the world, residing with her sister in the space of the void. Only being able to be brought down by a catastrophic
		accident. SO we shall incure this to happen to get to her ;p
